 In this note, we aim to derive the MPD equations for the Schwarzschild metric. Then, we examine
 the conservation of several generalized quantities within the MPD system of equations, and finally,
 we study the evolution of the spin vector of a test particle moving in Schwarzschild spacetime.
 This note is the first part of a series on the applications of the MPD equations. The second part
 will cover more details about a wider variety of motions in the Schwarzschild metric, as well as an
 examination of the radiative effects of the test particle and the coupling of electromagnetic waves
 and their spin with gravity and spacetime.
