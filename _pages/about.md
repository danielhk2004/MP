I'm Daniel Hakimi. I completed my middle and high school education at SAMPAD Schools (National Organization for Development of Exceptional Talents) in Iran. 

Currently, I am a student at Sharif University of Technology in Tehran, majoring in Physics. Alongside my main field of study, I am also pursuing Mathematics as a minor.

My academic interests lie in theoretical physics and mathematics, and I am passionate about studying and researching in these fields. 
This website serves as a platform where I share my ideas and writings with you. 

I hope you enjoy exploring my website!
